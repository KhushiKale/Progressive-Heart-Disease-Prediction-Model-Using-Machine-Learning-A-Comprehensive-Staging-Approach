of cardiovascular health. 

## Problem Definition:
Heart disease remains a significant global health concern, contributing to a substantial number of morbidity and mortality cases. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease and its stages can play a pivotal role in preventing adverse outcomes and improving patient outcomes. The complexity of cardiovascular health necessitates the development of advanced predictive models leveraging modern computational techniques and health data.
In this project, we have designed a model which will predict the severity of heart disease(stages) and also predict the possibility of heart disease based on the symptoms provided by the patient.

## Objective:
1. It can analyze large amounts of patient data, including medical records, imaging tests to identify patterns and predict the risk of developing heart disease. Machine learning algorithms can also assist in identifying specific heart conditions, such as arrhythmias, based on ECG data.
2. The primary objective is to design and implement a predictive model capable of accurately predicting the likelihood of heart disease and its potential stages based on relevant patient data.
3. The objective of this project is to check whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed with any cardiovascular heart disease based on their medical attributes such as gender, age, chest pain, fasting sugar level, etc and also predict the stages.

## Significance:
1. Machine learning algorithms, fed with vast patient data, effectively predict heart disease risk, enabling personalized medicine and improved healthcare outcomes.
2. Disease Prediction using Machine Learning is the system that is used to predict the diseases from the symptoms which are given by the patients or any user. The system processes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the output as the probability of the disease.

## Methodology:

### Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases represent a pervasive global health challenge, necessitating effective predictive models for early detection. This report presents a comprehensive methodology for the development of a machine learning model aimed at predicting heart disease presence (0/1), severity stages, and specific disease types. The study employs three distinct algorithms: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest.

### Data Collection
**Dataset:**
A meticulously curated dataset was assembled, encompassing a wide array of features crucial to heart health, including patient personal information like age and sex and clinical tests like chest pain type, resting BP value, cholesterol value, fasting BS value, resting ECG type, max HR value, Exercise Angina presence, old peak value, and ST slope type. The dataset is meticulously labeled, indicating binary outcomes for heart disease presence (0/1) and includes additional information on severity stages and disease types.

**Data Preprocessing:**
1.Data Cleaning
A rigorous data cleaning process was implemented to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step ensures the overall quality and integrity of the dataset.

2 Feature Selection
Feature selection involves a judicious process of identifying and retaining features that significantly contribute to the predictive performance of the model. This was achieved through a combination of statistical methods and domain expertise.

3 Data Encoding
Categorical variables were meticulously transformed into numerical representations using one-hot encoding techniques, ensuring compatibility with the machine learning algorithms.

4 Data Splitting
The dataset was strategically partitioned into distinct training and testing sets to facilitate effective model training and subsequent evaluation.

**Model Development:**
1 Decision Tree Model
The Decision Tree model was crafted through a rigorous training process, involving the fine-tuning of hyperparameters for optimal performance. The model's efficacy was subsequently evaluated using the dedicated testing set.

2 KNN Model
The KNN model was developed with careful consideration given to the determination of the optimal number of neighbors, achieved through a robust cross-validation process. The model was then trained on the designated training set and evaluated against the testing set.

3 Random Forest Model
The Random Forest model was meticulously constructed, optimizing the number of trees and other relevant hyperparameters. The model underwent comprehensive training on the training dataset, followed by rigorous evaluation on the dedicated testing set.

**Model Evaluation:**
1 Performance Metrics
A suite of performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), were employed to holistically assess the effectiveness of each model.

2 Severity Staging
Instances predicted as heart disease (1) underwent further assessment for severity staging (1, 2, 3). The accuracy of severity predictions was thoroughly evaluated.

3 Disease Type Classification
For instances predicting heart disease, the model was tasked with classifying specific disease types like CAD, CVR, heart attack, LVH, non-cardiac chest pain, stroke, and Ventricular Tachycardia.

6 Model Comparison
A detailed comparative analysis was conducted to discern the relative strengths and weaknesses of the three algorithms. The comparison was based on a careful consideration of the selected metrics to identify the most robust algorithm for heart disease prediction and severity staging.
